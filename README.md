# Echolalia_detection

Repository for my Master's Thesis 'Automatic detection of echolalic speech in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder'

## Contents

### 1.A: Transcription models
Adapted from Whisper Timestamped (with and without prior speaker diarization)

### 1.B: Transcription-based echolalia and self-repetition detection models

### 1.C: Audio-based echolalia and self-repetition detection models

- Training and testing procedures of both models, on the basis of extracted features (for procedure of feature extraction: see final models)
- Final models, that include feature extraction, classification by the trained classifier and output of predictions in pandas DataFrame + .TextGrid
